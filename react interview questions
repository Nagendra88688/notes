* Good Practices for React Optimization =======
      ✅ Use React.memo for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
      ✅ Use useCallback & useMemo for expensive functions and computed values.
      ✅ Provide a stable key prop when rendering lists (avoid using array index if possible).
      ✅ Split large components into smaller reusable components.
      ✅ Use React.lazy + Suspense for route-based or component-level lazy loading.
      ✅ Split vendor libraries (e.g., charts, editors) into separate bundles using Webpack or Vite.
      ✅ Load non-critical components only when needed (modals, dropdowns).
      ✅ Use uncontrolled components for forms if you don’t need to track every keystroke.
      ✅ Use windowing/virtualization libraries (React Window, React Virtualized) for large lists.
      ✅ Cache API responses using React Query, SWR, or RTK Query.
      ✅ Debounce/throttle expensive API calls (like search).
      ✅ Prefer Redux Toolkit / Zustand / Jotai for scalable global state.

* New features in latest version of React (19) ===========
  * Refs as props directly (i.e. no more forwardRef in many common cases) 
  * use() API: Allows reading a Promise or resource directly inside render (instead of via side effects), with built-in support for Suspense, etc. 
               Simplifies async data fetching in some rendering scenarios.


* LAZY LOADING =================
      - Lazy loading is a frontend optimization where resources (like images, components, or routes) are loaded only when 
      they are needed, instead of all initially loading at once. This improves performance and reduces bandwidth usage.

      -     import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";

            const Profile = lazy(() => import("./Profile")); // Lazy load component
            
            function App() {
              return (
                <div>
                  <h1>Dashboard</h1>
                  <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading profile...</p>}>
                    <Profile />  {/* Loaded only when needed */}
                  </Suspense>
                </div>
              );
            }

      - Lazy loading does the Code splitting, which is a performance optimization technique where your application’s JavaScript bundle is split
        into smaller chunks instead of one big file.


* React Virtualized============
       - React Virtualized is a popular library for efficiently rendering large lists, tables, and grids in React.
      
      👉 Instead of rendering thousands of DOM nodes at once (which slows down the app), React Virtualized only renders the items that are visible
          in the viewport plus a small buffer.
      👉 As you scroll, it reuses DOM nodes and renders new items dynamically.
      
      This technique is called windowing or virtualization.
