* HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) is a video streaming protocol developed by Apple that allows video to be delivered 
  smoothly and adaptively over the internet.

* HLS breaks a video into small chunks (segments) and streams them over standard HTTP, adjusting video quality 
  in real time based on the user’s internet speed.

* How HLS works:
    1. A video is encoded at multiple quality levels (e.g., 240p, 480p, 720p).
    2. Each quality is split into short segments (usually 2–10 seconds).
    3. A playlist file (.m3u8) tells the player which segments to load.
    4. The video player automatically switches quality depending on bandwidth and device performance.

* Why HLS is used
  ✅ Adaptive streaming – avoids buffering on slow networks
  ✅ Works on most devices (web, mobile, smart TVs)
  ✅ Firewall/CDN friendly (uses HTTP/HTTPS)
  ✅ Scales well for large platforms

* Instead of loading one big video file (like MP4), HLS works by:
  - Splitting a video into small .ts chunks (usually 2–10 seconds each)
  - Creating a playlist file (.m3u8) that lists those chunks
  - The player downloads chunks dynamically based on network speed

* HLS Player Component ===============

        import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
        import Hls from "hls.js";   // importing hls
        
        const HLSPlayer = ({ src }: { src: string }) => {
          const videoRef = useRef<HTMLVideoElement>(null);
        
          useEffect(() => {
            const video = videoRef.current;
            if (!video) return;
        
            // Safari natively supports HLS (both created by Apple)
            if (video.canPlayType("application/vnd.apple.mpegurl")) {
              video.src = src;
            }
            // Chrome / Firefox
            else if (Hls.isSupported()) {
              const hls = new Hls();
              hls.loadSource(src);    // loads & prepares data
              hls.attachMedia(video); // connects to <video>
        
              return () => hls.destroy();
            }
          }, [src]);
        
          return <video ref={videoRef} controls style={{ width: "100%" }} />;
        };
