* HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) is a video streaming protocol developed by Apple that allows video to be delivered 
  smoothly and adaptively over the internet.

* HLS breaks a video into small chunks (segments) and streams them over standard HTTP, adjusting video quality 
  in real time based on the user’s internet speed.

* How HLS works:
    1. A video is encoded at multiple quality levels (e.g., 240p, 480p, 720p).
    2. Each quality is split into short segments (usually 2–10 seconds).
    3. A playlist file (.m3u8) tells the player which segments to load.
    4. The video player automatically switches quality depending on bandwidth and device performance.

* Why HLS is used
  ✅ Adaptive streaming – avoids buffering on slow networks
  ✅ Works on most devices (web, mobile, smart TVs)
  ✅ Firewall/CDN friendly (uses HTTP/HTTPS)
  ✅ Scales well for large platforms
